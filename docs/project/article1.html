<p><b>Abstract<br/></b>Enzymes are complex biological catalysts and are critical to life. Most oxidations of chemicals are <br/>catalyzed by cytochrome P450 (P450, CYP) enzymes, which generally utilize mixed-function <br/>oxidase stoichiometry, utilizing pyridine nucleotides as electron donors: NAD(P)H + O2 + R &#8594; <br/>NAD(P)+ + RO + H2O (where R is a carbon substrate and RO is an oxidized product). The <br/>catalysis of oxidations is largely understood in the context of the heme iron-oxygen complex <br/>generally referred to as Compound I, formally FeO3+, whose basis was in peroxidase chemistry. <br/>Many X-ray crystal structures of P450s are now available (&#8805; 822 structures from &#8805;146 different <br/>P450s) and have helped in understanding catalytic specificity. In addition to hydroxylations, P450s <br/>catalyze more complex oxidations, including C-C bond formation and cleavage. Enzymes derived <br/>from P450s by directed evolution can even catalyze more unusual reactions, e.g. cyclopropanation. <br/>Current P450 questions under investigation include the potential role of the intermediate <br/>Compound 0 (formally FeIII-O2<br/></p>
<p>&#8722;) in catalysis of some reactions, the roles of high- and low-spin <br/>forms of Compound I, the mechanism of desaturation, the roles of open and closed structures of <br/>P450s in catalysis, the extent of processivity in multi-step oxidations, and the role of the accessory <br/>protein cytochrome b5. More global questions include exactly how structure drives function, <br/>prediction of catalysis, and roles of multiple protein conformations.<br/></p>

<p><b>Background and Introduction<br/></b>Catalysts come in many forms, and enzymes are the catalysts in most biological reactions. <br/>Like all catalysts, they are not consumed in reactions. Enzymes can control regioselectivity <br/>and stereospecificity of reactions of complex organic molecules and, because they are chiral <br/>catalysts (i.e., built of L-amino acids), they can induce stereoselectivity into seemingly non-<br/>chiral molecules (e.g., distinguish between pro-R and pro-S hydrogens on a simple <br/>methylene group such as that in ethanol1,2). Unlike most other catalysts, enzymes are <br/>synthesized in biological systems, coded for by genes.<br/></p>
<p>The functions of enzymes vary, and several types of enzymes catalyze oxidations and <br/>reductions.2 Of these, &#8805; 95% of those reported in the literature are done by cytochrome P450 <br/>(P450, CYP) enzymes.3 Most of the P450 reactions are oxidations and involve the use of <br/>molecular oxygen, i.e. O2. P450s almost always act as monooxygenases, or mixed-function <br/>oxidases, using the stoichiometry shown in Equation 1 and utilizing the pyridine nucleotide <br/>NADH or NADPH as a cofactor (used to deliver electrons via a flavoprotein, sometimes via <br/>an iron-sulfur protein)<br/></p>

<p>O2 + R + R&#8242; RO + R&#8242;O (3)<br/></p>
<p>where both oxygen atoms are incorporated into organic substrates.2,4&#8211;6<br/></p>
<p>An important concept to remember in catalysis involving oxygen is that O2 is in the triplet <br/>state and its direct reaction with singlet organic molecules is spin-forbidden.5&#8211;7 <br/></p>
<p>Metalloproteins such as P450s overcome this barrier by complexing the oxygen to a metal <br/>(iron), so that the metal-oxygen complex can react with carbon substrates, as well as some <br/>heteroatoms and even metals.8<br/></p>
<p>The first reports of P450 were published in 1962 and 1964.9&#8211;11 Before that time, the <br/>concepts of dioxygenases and mixed-function oxidases had been established by Hayaishi, <br/>Mason, and others.4,12,13 The concept of generating oxygenated compounds by activated <br/>oxygen species was in contrast to earlier views by Wieland and others that these alcohols <br/>and other oxygenated chemicals were generated from the activation of carbon and <br/>subsequent reaction with water.6,12&#8211;14 The connection between P450 and mixed-function <br/>oxidation (of a steroid) was made later by Cooper et al.15 using photochemical action <br/>spectra; i.e. light reversal of inhibition of a hydroxylation reaction by carbon monoxide.<br/></p>
<p>Subsequent work with bacterial and mammalian systems led to the purification of many <br/>P450s. Early proposals about the generation of mobile oxygen species and their roles16,17 <br/></p>
<p>have been abandoned in favor of high-valent iron oxygen complexes that do the oxidation <br/>chemistry, overcoming the problem of spin-forbidden reaction of singlet (carbon) substrates <br/>with triplet oxygen and restricting the regioselectivity of the reaction to a specific site(s) on a <br/>substrate.2,5,6 The oxygenated forms of P450 enzymes have considerable similarity to those <br/>used by other iron-based monooxygenases and dioxygenases.6,18<br/></p>
<p><b>Current Understanding<br/></b>The catalytic cycle shown in Scheme 1 is generally accepted for most P450- catalyzed <br/>oxidations. The intermediates between steps <b>4</b> and <b>8</b> are unstable and have been difficult to <br/>characterize. There is some ambiguity in the exact location of the electronic charge in these <br/>entities, and variations are seen in the literature, i.e. in the distribution of charge in the iron <br/>atom, the Fe-O bond, and the porphyrin ring.<br/></p>
<p>Most P450 oxidations are considered to occur via Compound I, the formal FeO3+ entity <br/>shown in Scheme 1 (i.e., steps <b>7</b> and <b>8</b>), named because of its history in peroxidase <br/>chemistry.20 Much of our understanding of the catalysis came from work on biomimetic <br/>models; i.e. model metalloporphyrin oxide complexes.21,22 Compound I has been <br/>characterized in some bacterial P450s by Green and associates23&#8211;25 and by Makris and <br/>associates.26 Compound I abstracts a hydrogen atom from an alkyl group (e.g., methyl, <br/>methylene) yielding a carbon radical (step <b>7</b> in Scheme 1). The formal Fe-OH complex <br/>reacts rapidly with this radical to generate the product, often an alcohol, in a so-called <br/>&#8220;oxygen rebound&#8221; step (step <b>8</b> in Scheme 1).

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>Hoffman and Sligar, it has been possible to characterize dioxygen intermediates of P450 <br/>101A1 (P450cam) and P450 11A1 by ENDDR spectroscopy and to document catalytic <br/>competence as judged by product formation.27&#8211;29<br/></p>
<p>At this point it should be mentioned that many X-ray crystal structures are now available (&#8805; <br/>822 structures for &#8805; 146 different P450s currently in the Protein Data Bank, with 112 <br/>uploaded but not yet released as of the date of revision of this manuscript). These have <br/>generally similar folds but the size and shape of the active site vary considerably, yielding <br/>catalytic specificity among P450s.30 Most of the structures are of ferric enzymes, many with <br/>substrates or inhibitors present. Some structures of ferrous and ferrous-oxygen complexes of <br/>bacterial P450s 101A1 (P450cam) and 107A1 (P450eryF) are available (e.g., PDB 1DZ8, <br/>1T88, 2A1M, 2A1N, 2A1O, 1Z8O, 1Z8P, 1Z8Q)30&#8211;33<br/></p>
<p>Not all P450 reactions are carbon hydroxylations, but Compound I is involved in these as <br/>well. Compound I has a high oxidation-reduction potential and, when in the proper position, <br/>can abstract electrons from amines34&#8211;36 and other relatively low potential reductants, e.g. <br/>certain strained alkanes and substituted aromatic ring systems.37,38 The abstraction of an <br/>electron from an amine is the initial step in many N-dealkylation reactions.19,34,39,40 With <br/>some of these amines and also carbon substrates, the carbon radical generated in step <b>7 <br/></b>(Scheme 1) can rearrange before step <b>8</b> occurs,41 even though the rebound reaction is <br/>generally fast. This competition between oxygen rebound and rearrangement can be <br/>&#8220;clocked&#8221; with strained alkanes having known rates of rearrangement in solution.42,43 Other <br/>competing reactions with Compound I are reduction to water44 and abstraction of a phenolic <br/>hydrogen atom from a (P450) tyrosyl group, which confounded early efforts to characterize <br/>Compound I.25,45&#8211;48<br/></p>
<p>For more extensive lists of rearrangements and more unusual oxidation reactions catalyzed <br/>by P450s, see references 6, 8, 19, 49, 50. Most of these can be rationalized by mechanisms <br/>involving Compound I, with Compound 0 (Scheme 1) possibly involved in others.<br/></p>
<p><b>Current Questions<br/>Compound I vs. Compound 0.<br/></b></p>
<p>Compound 0 (formally FeIII-O2<br/>&#8722; or its protonated form) has been invoked in some P450 <br/></p>
<p>reactions that have been difficult to explain with Compound I.8,19 The difficulty in <br/>discriminating between Compound 0 and Compound I derives from instability of these <br/>species and the transformation of Compound 0 to Compound I in the catalytic cycle <br/>(Scheme 1). Any effort to discern these by site-directed mutagenesis of a P450 has the <br/>caveat that other aspects (not only proton transfer) have been modified. Compound I is an <br/>inherently electrophilic species and (unprotonated) Compound 0 is nucleophilic. The use of <br/>&#8220;oxygen surrogates&#8221; can be useful, with appropriate caveats, e.g. iodosylbenzene (and alkyl <br/>hydroperoxides) can generate Compound I (or a closely-related structure51,52) but cannot <br/>produce the dioxygenated complex Compound 0 (Scheme 1).<br/></p>
<p>One of the historically dominant pieces of evidence supporting a role for Compound 0 was <br/>18O2 labeling work with P450 19A1, in which one atom of 18O was reported to be <br/></p>

<p>Another P450 C-C cleavage reaction, the periodate-like cleavage of 20,22- <br/>dihydroxycholesterol to two carbonyl products, is done by P450 11A1 Compound I, as <br/>demonstrated by a relatively high yield (~ 50%) of product formed by radiolytically-<br/>generated Compound I.29<br/></p>
<p>The case of the P450 17A1-catalyzed cleavage of 17&#945;-hydroxy steroids (&#8220;lyase&#8221; reaction) is <br/>more problematic, in that the documented incorporation of one atom of 18O58 has been <br/>repeated52 but this result is not unambiguous regarding the mechanism. Raman spectral <br/>evidence for a Compound 0 species has been generated in the presence of substrate but this <br/>entity has not been shown to be catalytically competent (i.e., converted to product).59&#8211;61 <br/></p>
<p>lodosylbenzene and 17&#945;-hydroperoxy steroids (oxygen surrogates) both yield the 19-carbon <br/>lyase reaction products,52,62 but the involvement of Compound 0 in the normal reaction <br/>cannot be ruled out.6<br/></p>
<p>The purported roles of Compound 0 in other reactions remain to be investigated, e.g. <br/>lanosterol 14 &#945;-demethylation (P450 51 species)63 and the cleavage of nabumetone.64,65<br/></p>
<p><b>Multiple States of Compound I.<br/></b>Theoretical calculations, primarily by Shaik and his associates, have largely discounted all <br/>potential oxygenated intermediates other than Compound I in the catalytic cycle (Scheme 1) <br/>as unable to be involved in P450 oxidations, including Compound 0 and Compound II <br/>(formally FeOH3+, following step <b>7</b> in Scheme 1).66 Theory has also led to the concept of <br/>&#8220;two-state reactivity,&#8221; i.e. the view that different forms of Compound I are involved in <br/>different reactions, even with a single substrate. This subject (which is too complex to fully <br/>consider here) is often approached in the context of &#8220;high-spin&#8221; and &#8220;low-spin&#8221; states of <br/>Compound I and their reactivity, but the possibilities for electronic distribution and multiple <br/>forms of Compound I are more complex. Shaik and associates use the term &#8220;chameleon <br/>nature&#8221; of Compound I, meaning that Compound I can change its character depending upon <br/>its environment. That is, the juxtaposition of a substrate in the enzyme can shift the balance <br/>of states of Compound I and affect the mechanism.66<br/></p>
<p>The concept has attraction in explaining multiple reaction courses. For instance, epoxidation <br/>of aryl compounds is observed along with formation of phenols and ketones, but the epoxide <br/>does not necessarily form the products nor does a Meissenheimer complex necessariily form <br/>epoxides. Epoxidation of olefins is often accompanied by 1,2- shifts indicative of cationic <br/>intermediates (plus heme destruction).67&#8211;69 These sets of reactions have often been <br/>attributed to a single P450 intermediate that collapses in different ways (Scheme 2A)8,70 but <br/>the chameleon theory would suggest different electronic distributions of Compound I <br/>participating in formation of different products (Scheme 2B).<br/></p>

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>This concept sounds very reasonable but unfortunately it is not very possible to prove <br/>experimentally (unless one considers more theoretical work experimental). The theoretical <br/>considerations are based largely on rationalization of prior experimental data, and <br/>development of new predictions that could distinguish among alternate mechanisms is <br/>difficult. In principle, the barrier to one reaction could be raised and the result observed, in <br/>terms of product redistribution (Scheme 2). However, the result could be explained by either <br/>(i) shifting the positioning of the substrate in the active site to favor one reaction (due to <br/>substrate motion) or (ii) to the ability of alternate forms of Compound I to do the reaction (at <br/>the same site in the protein). Although bond strength is one issue in influencing product <br/>reactivity (e.g., the preference of allylic sites for hydroxylation71), it is not the only one and <br/>examples of deficiencies in prediction are considered later (vide infra,).72<br/></p>
<p>In the author&#8217;s opinion, these issues may ultimately be addressed experimentally in studies <br/>with artificially-generated Compound I (vide supra), in which detailed spectral analysis and <br/>product measurements are done.23&#8211;26,29<br/></p>
<p><b>Open vs. Closed Structures.<br/></b>More crystal structures (&#8805; 119) of bacterial P450 101A1 (P450cam) are available than for any <br/>other P450. These structures, with the substrate camphor and other ligands (e.g., PDB 2CPP, <br/>7CPP, 1PHA, 1PHB, 1PHC, 5IK1), can be grouped into three conformational states: open, <br/>closed, and intermediate.30,73&#8211;76 The states involve differential movements of the F and G <br/>helices that cover the substrate binding channel. The studies support a view that this protein <br/>exists in a small set of distinct conformations, rather than a more continuous distribution of <br/>malleable, induced-fit states.76 How this paradigm applies to mammalian and other <br/>eukaryotic P450s is unknown, although there is considerable evidence that those enzymes <br/>also have at least open and closed conformations.30<br/></p>
<p>One issue is the effect of the auxiliary protein putidaredoxin on the structure of P450cam. <br/>Putidaredoxin has long been known to be the immediate electron donor to P450cam,77 but it <br/>has also been known for many years to have an additional &#8220;effector&#8221; role in catalysis, in <br/>which it enhances product formation in a role separate from electron delivery.78 Although <br/>this role has been known since 1972,78 the exact mechanism has remained unclear. The <br/>general consensus is that oxidized putidaredoxin remains bound to the reduced P450 Fe2+O2 <br/>(or Fe3+-O2<br/></p>
<p>&#8722;) complex long enough to alter its conformation and facilitate steps <b>5</b>&#8211;<b>8</b> of the <br/>catalytic cycle (Scheme 1). Several structural studies have provided contrasting answers to <br/>how this happens. A crystallographic study with a crosslinked P450cam-putidaredoxin <br/>complex indicated that P450cam was in the open form (with product bound),79 as did an <br/>independent double-electron-electron resonance (DEER) study with spin labels attached to <br/>P450cam.80 However, an NMR complex yielded an opposite result, i.e. a closed complex <br/>with P450cam.81<br/></p>
<p>These studies leave questions open about the catalytic mechanism, and the exact relevance to <br/>most eukaryotic P450s is unknown. Further DEER studies on P450cam with different spin <br/>labels also show that oxidized putidaredoxin induces reduced P450cam to change to the open <br/>form.76 Carbon monoxide binding somehow prevents this shift. Further DEER <br/>measurements have indicated that putidaredoxin binds to the same site of P450cam in both <br/></p>

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>the open and closed forms.82 Apparently this binding triggers the conformational change <br/>through rather subtle structural interactions.82 Exactly how this information is relevant to the <br/>human P450 redox partner interactions is still unclear (i.e., NADPH-P450 reductase and <br/>cytochrome b5 (b5) in the microsomal P450s and adrenodoxin in the mitochondrial P450s).<br/></p>
<p><b>Desaturation.<br/></b>Numerous examples of P450-catalyzed desaturations are known, and the process does not <br/>involve dehydration of an alcohol product.8 In many cases, the desaturated product is minor <br/>relative to the alcohol, consistent with the view that a common intermediate (step <b>7</b>, Scheme <br/>1) leads to both.83&#8211;85 In several cases,86&#8211;90 including fish and human P450s,91,92 the major <br/>or only product is the desaturated product.<br/></p>
<p>Presumably the reaction involves the abstraction of a second hydrogen atom in the FeOH3+ <br/></p>
<p>radical intermediate (Schemes 1, 3). Whether this is actually a hydrogen atom abstraction or <br/>proton-coupled electron transfer is not clear. Site-directed mutagenesis work with (non-<br/>heme) iron-based fatty acid desaturases and the iron/&#945;- ketoglutarate dioxygenase AsqJ <br/>indicates that the balance between desaturation and hydroxylation is rather sensitive to <br/>minor changes,86,93&#8211;95 and P450s are probably similar in this regard (Scheme 3).<br/></p>
<p><b>Processivity.<br/></b>Many P450 reactions involve multiple steps, i.e. a product of one reaction is a substrate for a <br/>subsequent reaction by the same enzyme. An issue is the degree to which the two reactions <br/>are &#8220;processive,&#8221; i.e. the extent to which the first product is released by the enzyme and must <br/>re-bind to generate the final product. If a reaction is not processive, it is &#8220;dissociative&#8221; <br/>(Scheme 4). The balance is not simply a matter of kinetic curiosity, but the coupling of <br/>reactions (i.e., degree of processivity) is an indication of whether a biological process is <br/>deterministic or stochastic. A more deterministic sequence of reactions may be important, in <br/>terms of biological function. The nature of the processivity can also be an issue when <br/>considering development of enzyme inhibitors.96,97<br/></p>
<p>This issue has been investigated in several cases involving steroid oxidations.97&#8211;102 The <br/>design of such experiments is critical, and pre-steady-state kinetic approaches are necessary.<br/>103 Our own work led to the conclusion that the three steps in the P450 19A1 steroid <br/>aromatase reaction are distributive.102 Studies on animal and human P450 17A1 reactions <br/>(steroid 17&#945;-hydroxylation and subsequent C17 &#945;,20 cleavage (lyase reaction)) indicate <br/>partial processivity,97&#8211;101 although only in the case of the human P450 17A1 studies was the <br/>highly stimulatory protein b5 included.97<br/></p>
<p>Pulse-chase experiments indicated that the P450 2E1-catalyzed oxidations of ethanol and <br/>N,N -diethylnitrosamine to acetic acid are both processive, with the latter being less <br/>processive than the oxidation of N,N-dimethylnitrosamine to formic acid (Scheme 4).105,106 <br/></p>
<p>P450 2A6 also showed processivity in the same oxidation of the above two nitrosamines to <br/>1- and 2-carbon carboxylic acids.107 However, in these reactions the results were not fit to <br/>quantitative models with rate constants for both product dissociation and the second <br/></p>

<p>Other P450s known to catalyze sequential oxidations with endogenous chemicals include <br/>11A1, 11B1, 11B2, 24A1, 27A1, 46A1, and 51A1. Human P450s catalyzing sequential <br/>reactions with xenobiotics include 1A1, 1A2, 1B1, 2A6, 2A13, 2C9, 2E1, and 3A4.<br/></p>
<p><b>Role of b5.<br/></b>b5 is a microsomal heme protein that has an electron transfer role in fatty acid desaturation <br/>and some other enzymatic reactions.2 In 1971, Estabrook and Hildebrandt108 postulated <br/>that b5 could be involved in P450 reactions in rat liver microsomes, on the basis of results of <br/>stimulation with the cofactor NADH, which only interacts poorly with NADPH-P450 <br/>reductase to reduce P450s but reduces NADH- b5 reductase and then b5. With the <br/>purification and reconstitution of P450s and b5, a number of results have been reported. <br/>Depending upon the system, investigators have reported either no effect, stimulation, or <br/>inhibition with the addition of b5.109&#8211;112 Even with a given P450, the results can vary <br/>depending upon the reaction under consideration.110,113<br/></p>
<p>The original postulate was that b5 is transferring the second electron (to the Fe2+O2 (or Fe3+<br/></p>

<p>of heme) or Mn2+-substituted b5 can stimulate as well as holo-b5 (with the normal heme).<br/>114&#8211;117 A proposal that heme is transferred from the P450s to the apo-b5 during the course of <br/>enzyme reactions118 was shown to be untenable.119<br/></p>
<p>At least four mechanisms for b5 stimulation have been proposed: (i) electron transfer (to the <br/>Fe2+O2 (or Fe3+&#8722;O2<br/></p>
<p>&#8722;) complex, step <b>4</b>, Scheme 1); (ii) an allosteric effect that favors a more <br/>active conformation of the P450s; (iii) an effect of decreasing the abortive use of electrons to <br/>generate H2O2, avoiding uncoupling; and (iv) facilitating the protonation of the hydroperoxo <br/>intermediate (step <b>5</b> in Scheme 1). Waskell and colleagues have provided EPR evidence for <br/>the latter proposal in the case of rabbit P450 2B4-catalyzed d-benzphetamine N-<br/>demethylation,120 although this reaction is not strongly influenced by the presence of b5 <br/>under all conditions.110 Enhanced protonation of the peroxo complex would actually be <br/>inhibitory to the strong stimulation of the lyase activity of the P450 17A1 if the proposed <br/>nucleophilic Compound 0 mechanism58&#8211;61 is viable, in that decomposition to Compound I <br/>would be facilitated. Apo-b5 can stimulate reactions as well as b5 with several <br/>P450s114,117,119 but is ineffective with some P450 reactions,117,121&#8211;124 thus implicating <br/>electron transfer in those.<br/></p>
<p>There are several experimental deficiencies in the b5 field. Clearly b5 must bind to P450s, as <br/>shown by NMR perturbation125 and crosslinking126 studies, but estimates of binding <br/>parameters have only been made in two cases, and then by surface plasmon resonance,<br/>127,128 which can be notoriously inaccurate due to surface artifacts.104 No crystal structures <br/>of b5:P450 complexes are known (other than computational). Also, kinetic investigations <br/>with b5 and high-valent P450 intermediates are limited because b5 must be preincubated <br/>with P450 in vesicles (i.e., unlike a ferredoxin it cannot be added quickly in a stopped-flow <br/>experiment). NMR investigations by Estrada and Scott125 also indicate that b5 and NADPH-<br/></p>

<p>To add to the complexity are in vivo transgenic mouse experiments.124,130 Conditional <br/>deletion of microsomal b5 in liver creates a liver b5-null mouse, but these mice develop and <br/>breed normally and have no overt phenotype. In liver microsomes prepared from these <br/>animals, NADH-mediated metabolism was essentially abolished for most substrates, and the <br/>NADPH-dependent metabolism of many substrates was reduced by 50&#8211;90%131 (the <br/>NADH-b5 reductase/b5-supported reduction of P450s can be reconstituted in vitro, despite <br/>the unfavorable redox potential of b5 for reducing ferric P450s (step <b>2</b> in Scheme 1)123,132). <br/>The results indicate that microsomal b5 can play a major role in the in vivo metabolism of <br/>certain drugs and chemicals but in a rather P450- and substrate-dependent manner.130 The <br/>extent to which metabolism was significantly affected by the (hepatic) absence of b5 is <br/>substrate-dependent.131 In mice treated with the carcinogen benzo[a]pyrene, in vivo DNA <br/>adduct levels were significantly higher (7-fold) in the livers of (liver) NADPH-P450 <br/>reductase knockout mice than wild-type mice.124 In the same study, no significant <br/>difference in DNA adduct formation was observed in liver between NADH-b5 reductase-null <br/>and wild-type mice. Thus, NADPH- P450 reductase and b5 both appear to modulate P450-<br/>mediated activation of benzo[a]pyrene in vitro but hepatic P450 enzymes appear to be more <br/>important for benzo[a]pyrene detoxication than its activation in vivo.<br/></p>
<p><b>What are the Limits of P450 Catalysis?<br/></b>Recent work by Arnold and associates133&#8211;137 and also by the Fasan group138&#8211;145 has pushed <br/>the limits of what P450s&#8212;and other heme proteins&#8212;can do in the realm of catalysis. <br/>Arnold&#8217;s work in directed evolution, which was recognized by a share of the 2018 Nobel <br/>Prize in Chemistry, includes &#8805; 47 papers with P450s and their derivatives.<br/></p>
<p>This area developed largely from work with bacterial P450 102A1 (P450bm3), which has <br/>advantages over most other P450s in that it is self-sufficient (i.e., it has a reductase domain <br/>that binds NADPH and delivers electrons to the heme domain, eliminating the need to co-<br/>express a separate reductase), high catalytic activity towards fatty acids (turnover number ~ <br/>200 s&#8722;1), and high expression levels.146 Directed evolution (or, more appropriately <br/>&#8220;molecular breeding&#8221;), with high throughput selection methods, was used to develop <br/>modified P450 102A1 catalysts that can catalyze various transformations of interest.137 <br/></p>
<p>Some of the reactions involve drugs, and batteries of mutated P450 102A1 catalysts can be <br/>used to screen for their abilities to synthesize drug metabolites and new lead molecules.147<br/></p>
<p>Further studies led to the ability to catalyze propane 1-hydroxylation, a dramatic departure <br/>from the classical &#969;&#8722;1, &#969;&#8722;2, &#8230; hydroxylation of fatty acids.148 Another development was <br/>the synthesis of anti-Markovnikov carbonyl products from styrenes by selected P450 102A1 <br/>mutants (Scheme 5A),135 although it should be noted that such reactions had been <br/>demonstrated earlier with rat P450 2B168 and with P450 biomimetic models.149<br/></p>
<p>Further molecular breeding, incorporating random and site-directed mutagenesis and <br/>unnatural amino acid mutagenesis, has yielded P450-derived enzymes that can catalyze <br/>unusual reactions, e.g. cyclopropanation and nitrene transfer (Scheme 5B,5C).133,134,143 <br/></p>

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>These reactions do not involve the normal P450 chemistry (Scheme 1), and Arnold&#8217;s group <br/>found that substitution of the conserved cysteine heme ligand by serine led to higher activity.<br/>137 These catalysts are no longer P450s, by definition (no thiolate ligand or classical FeII-<br/>CO spectrum) and have been termed P411 by Arnold.137,150 Nevertheless, some of these <br/>P411 variants are capable of highly stereoselective catalysis.134<br/></p>
<p>The nitrene transfer mechanism (Scheme 6),144 with roots in earlier work by White151 and <br/>Dawson and Breslow,152 is rather unrelated to the normal catalytic cycle (Scheme 1). <br/>Consistent with the P411 catalysis, these reactions can also be catalyzed by myoglobin <br/>derivatives.140<br/></p>
<p><b>Further Unresolved Issues<br/>Exactly How Does Structure Drive Function?<br/></b></p>
<p>At least 822 P450 structures (from &gt; 146 P450s) are available in the Protein Data Bank, and <br/>a large fraction contain bound ligands. In many cases, the atom(s) on the substrate that is <br/>oxidized is positioned closest to the heme iron and, presumably, the oxygen of the FeO3+ <br/></p>
<p>complex (Compound I). Such structures can explain many P450 reactions, and it is certainly <br/>easier to understand reactions with enzyme structures than without any.<br/></p>
<p>However, there are some gaps in the field, aside from the difficulty in crystallizing some of <br/>the P450s. As pointed out earlier, there is a paucity of structures of complexes with <br/>accessory proteins. Examples are with ferredoxin-P450 fusion proteins, one a mitochondrial <br/>P450 (11A1)153 (PDB 3N9Y, 3NA1, 3N9Z, 3NA0, 4JWS, 4JWU, 4JX1, 3W9C) and two <br/>others with bacterial P450 101A1.79,154 The only other case involves the separated heme and <br/>flavin domains of bacterial P450 102A1 (1BVY).155<br/></p>
<p>Another issue is that the structures can explain major sites of reaction, but structures <br/>explaining minor products are not generally seen due to the energetic differences in binding <br/>in the less favorable conformations. In this regard, the computational prediction software <br/>may even be more generally useful than structural models.<br/></p>
<p>Another issue is that there are some examples of explaining natural human (or other) genetic <br/>variants at a structural level but not many (e.g., PDB 5X23, 5X24).156 For instance, it would <br/>be interesting (and useful) to understand why the human P450 2D6*53 variant has higher <br/>activity than wild-type P450 2D6.157 Two recent examples from our own group exemplify <br/>the problems. Zebrafish P450 17A1 and P450 17A2 both catalyze steroid 17&#945;-<br/>hydroxylations (progesterone and pregnenolone) but only P450 17A1 will catalyze the <br/>second (lyase) reaction, i.e., cleaving the C17-C20 bond (vide supra).158 However, the X-ray <br/>structure showed nearly identical active sites,158 and site-directed mutagenesis of all five <br/>possible perturbations (four near the heme periphery) did not impart lyase activity to P450 <br/>17A2.62 In the case of human P450 21A2, &gt; 100 single amino acid substitutions have been <br/>reported, with clinical deficiencies. Although having the structure of wild-type P450 21A2 is <br/>useful in understanding the low-activity variants,159&#8211;161 we have been unsuccessful in <br/>obtaining diffractable crystals of any of the variants.<br/></p>

<p>, in which a difference of 1.3 kcal mol&#8722;1, less than a typical single hydrogen bond, translates <br/>to a 10-fold difference in reaction rate at 37 &#176;C (KB is the Boltzmann constant, h is Planck&#8217;s <br/>constant, and T is the absolute temperature). Further, a free energy difference of 6.4 kcal mol<br/>&#8722;1 is associated with a 50,000-fold change in the rate. Thus, small differences in structure <br/>(binding) can lead to major changes in catalysis. This, of course, is an issue not only for <br/>P450s but for all efforts at understanding enzyme structure-function relationships.<br/></p>
<p><b>Prediction of Catalysis.<br/></b>As mentioned earlier, structural models have the capability of understanding regioselectivity <br/>of oxidation reactions and even predicting sites with new ligands. The experience to date <br/>with AutoDock programs162,163 is not better than with programs such as MetaSite164&#8211;166 <br/></p>
<p>that are based on past history with similar molecules, in the absence of structural constraints. <br/>Success rates of ~ 80% in predicting the top three sites of oxidation are reasonable and <br/>competitive with predictions by trained drug metabolism experts.167,168<br/></p>
<p>There are still anomalies that would not be predicted. For instance, testosterone and the <br/>important androgenic derivative dihydrotestosterone differ only in a double bond and twists <br/>in the (steroid) A-ring. However, P450 3A4 hydroxylates testosterone at the 6&#946; position <br/>(plus lesser amounts of hydroxylation at the 2&#946;, 1&#946;, and 15&#946; positions)71,169 but <br/>dihydrotestosterone is hydroxylated primarily at the thermodynamically unfavored C18 <br/>methyl group.72<br/></p>
<p>Another deficiency, especially in the field of drug metabolism, is that we do not really have <br/>the ability to predict rates of oxidation of compounds, even when we can predict sites. This <br/>can realistically only be done in situations where Hammett analysis (with substituted aryl <br/>groups)170,171 or some other well-defined linear free energy or another quantitative <br/>structural-activity paradigm can be applied. Beyond such cases we have limited predictably <br/>with new substrates, as well as with predicting the effects of most single-amino acid <br/>substitutions in P450s. As noted above, the problem can be appreciated when the Erying <br/>relationship is considered.<br/></p>
<p><b>Multiple Conformations.<br/></b>One of the reasons why structural predictions are not better is the presence of multiple <br/>conformations of P450 proteins. There is considerable evidence for their existence, both <br/>from the structures of proteins bound to different ligands30,96,172 and from the existence of <br/>multiple crosspeaks in NMR spectra.173 In principle, NMR methods would be more useful <br/>in revealing multiple conformations but solving structures is formidable for such large <br/>proteins. Through-space spectroscopic methods such as fluorescence and EPR tagging are <br/></p>

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>qualitatively useful but also deficient in revealing total individual structures (and necessarily <br/>require perturbation of the protein). Molecular dynamics simulations, although more <br/>theoretical than experimental, can also address questions about multiple configurations.<br/></p>
<p>The existence of multiple conformations of P450s, or at the very least multiple docking <br/>models, is self-evident in considering multiplicity of reaction products from a single enzyme <br/>and substrate. There is also extensive evidence for substrate-induced conformational changes <br/>upon binding, as clearly evidenced in the crystal structures30 (and NMR <br/>measurements125,173).<br/></p>
<p>One question is whether these changes involve induced fit or conformational selection <br/>models (Scheme 7), a general issue in enzymology.174 In the induced fit model, the binding <br/>of the substrate leads to a conformation change. In contrast, in the conformational selection <br/>model, multiple states of the unbound protein coexist, one of which has substrate <br/>complementarity and binds (Scheme 7). Which of the two mechanisms is dominant with <br/>P450s is unclear, although some of our own kinetic studies with P450 3A4 led to a <br/>preference for an induced fit model.175 The two phenomena are not mutually exclusive, and <br/>we have utilized two forms of both free and bound P450 to obtain fits of ligand binding <br/>kinetic data.97,102,175,176 However, the improved fitting seen with adding more steps may be <br/>misleading, in that the most minimal kinetic models are generally the safest even if not the <br/>most complete.103<br/></p>
<p>We have explored the effects of substrate binding on circular dichroism spectra. However, <br/>any changes seen are probably too weak to be useful, in that changes in helicity are needed.<br/></p>
<p>Another anomaly of substrate binding is the slow changes in heme perturbation spectra seen <br/>with some P450s. Bacterial P450 101A1 binds its substrate (camphor) rapidly (k= 106 M&#8722;1s<br/>&#8722;1)177 and so do several human P450s.102,121,122,159 However, under the same conditions <br/>several mammalian P450s show slow changes in heme perturbation spectra upon mixing <br/>with substrate.92,175,176,178,179 In some cases the rates of initial contact of the substrate/<br/>ligand with the P450 has been shown to be fast, as judged by fluorescence kinetics of <br/>interaction of ligands with the protein.102,175,179 The slow heme perturbation results are <br/>currently rationalized in models that involve diffusion- limited encounters of a substrate with <br/>a ligand followed by conformational changes and &#8220;worming&#8221; of the ligand into the active <br/>site, moving near the heme iron.179 However, it is presently unclear why some P450s exhibit <br/>such behavior and others do not, as well as whether an induced fit or a conformational <br/>selection model is more relevant.<br/></p>
<p><b>Conclusions<br/></b>P450 is a mature field, in that the basic catalytic mechanism is understood in the context of <br/>electronic changes leading to oxygen activation and the oxidation of a substrate (Scheme 1). <br/>Questions still exist about some of the electronics of Compound I and possibly other active <br/>species. More questions abound about the role of the protein structure in driving catalytic <br/>selectivity, including internal motion and conformational changes. Prediction of altered <br/></p>
